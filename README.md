# todo-txt

> Your tasks are a file. Not a subscription, not a cloud account — a file.

A fast, format-faithful [todo.txt](http://todotxt.org/) CLI **and iOS app** with a powerful `focus` view,
rich recurrence rules, and zero lock-in. Your data is always a plain `.txt` file you own,
sync however you like, and read without any app.

The CLI and iOS app share all business logic — the same pure functions power both interfaces.
Point the iOS app at the same file as your CLI (via iCloud Drive or a shared path) and they
stay in sync automatically.

## In action

```
$ todo focus

   7  today              (A) Call the dentist
  12  today 14:00        Team standup +work
  23  Fri May 9          Review PR +backend
  31  Mon May 12         Pay rent
  45  Thu May 15         Mom's birthday  ↻ May 15 2027
  67  Fri May 16         Book club  ↻ Fri Jun 20
```

Overdue tasks appear in red. Priority tasks lead the line. Recurring items show their cadence.

## Install

### CLI

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caritos/todo-txt
cd todo-txt
bun install
bun link   # registers the global `todo` command
```

### iOS app

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
npx expo run:ios
```

Requires Xcode and an Apple Developer account for device builds. The simulator works without one.

## Quick start

```bash
todo add "Fix login bug +backend @work"
todo add "(A) Call dentist due:2026-05-09"
todo focus                    # your next 2 weeks at a glance
todo done 7                   # mark task 7 complete
todo list +backend            # filter by project
todo search "dentist"
```

## Scheduling extensions

Add these `key:value` pairs to any task or event:

| Extension | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `start:<date>` | Start date — `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm` | `start:2026-05-10T09:00` |
| `end:<date>` | End date — `YYYY-MM-DD`, for multi-day spans | `end:2026-05-12` |
| `end-time:<time>` | End time of day — `HH:MM`, for events with a `start:` time | `end-time:09:30` |
| `due:<date>` | Due date (shown in focus when approaching or overdue) | `due:2026-05-15` |
| `frequency:<freq>` | Recurrence: `daily` `weekly` `monthly` `yearly` | `frequency:weekly` |
| `every:<n>` | Repeat every N weeks with frequency:weekly (e.g. bi-weekly) | `every:2` |
| `frequency-day:<days>` | Days of week: `M,T,W,Th,F,Sat,Sun` | `frequency-day:M,W,F` |
| `frequency-month-day:<val>` | Day of month: `1–31` or `first-monday`, `last-weekend-day`, … | `frequency-month-day:first-tuesday` |
| `frequency-month:<months>` | Months for yearly recurrence | `frequency-month:Jan,Jun` |

### Positional day values for `frequency-month-day`

`first` · `second` · `third` · `fourth` · `fifth` · `last` combined with a day type:

| Day type | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `monday` … `sunday` | Specific weekday |
| `weekday` | Any Mon–Fri |
| `weekend-day` | Sat or Sun |
| `day` | Any calendar day |

### Examples

```bash
todo event "Standup start:2026-05-10T09:00 frequency:weekly frequency-day:M,W,F"
todo event "Standup start:2026-05-10T09:00 end-time:09:30 frequency:weekly frequency-day:M,W,F"
todo add "Pay rent frequency:monthly frequency-month-day:1"
todo event "Book club start:2026-05-06 frequency:monthly frequency-month-day:first-tuesday"
todo edit 45 "Mom's birthday start:1975-05-15 frequency:yearly type:anniversary"
todo edit 45 "Mother's Day start:2026-05-10 frequency:yearly frequency-month-day:second-sunday type:anniversary"
todo skip 23       # skip this week's basketball; it moves to next occurrence
```

### Focus behaviour

- Recurring tasks show their **next upcoming occurrence** even after same-day completion.
- Multi-day events (`start:` … `end:`) appear as **today** while the event is ongoing.
- A task whose `start:` is in the future appears on that future date, not today.
- `recur-until:<date>` ends a recurring series; tasks older than 2 years auto-expire.

## Format

Follows the [todo.txt format](https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt) exactly. Tasks are plain text lines:

```
(A) 2026-05-08 Call the dentist due:2026-05-09 +health @personal
x 2026-05-07 2026-05-06 Renew passport +admin
```

Your file works with any todo.txt-compatible app, editor, or script.
