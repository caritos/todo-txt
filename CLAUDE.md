### sim.sh build behavior

`sim.sh` always builds the **Release** configuration for both simulators and USB-connected physical devices — there is no Debug/dev-client picker. This means every local build is Metro-free: the simulator path installs and launches the built `.app` directly via `simctl`, and the device path installs and launches directly via `devicectl`, with no "Development servers / npx expo start" screen and no Metro dependency at all.

**Release builds are always a full clean build, never incrementally reused** (`mobile/scripts/sim.sh`, the DerivedData-staleness check). `expo-dev-client`'s podspec links `expo-dev-launcher` only for the `Debug` pod configuration (`:configurations => :debug`) — a genuinely fresh Release build never includes the dev-client launcher and boots straight into the app (verified: a fresh Release `.app` has zero `EXDevLauncher` symbols/resources, and installing+launching it lands directly on the Calendar screen). The bug this guards against: an incrementally-reused Release build in DerivedData can be a stale artifact cached from before some pod/config change, silently still carrying the old (possibly dev-launcher-linked) binary — `Podfile.lock`'s mtime alone isn't a reliable signal that a cached build still reflects the current pod graph. If DerivedData is missing (e.g. after running `cleanup-disk-space.sh`) or `Podfile.lock` is newer than the last build, `sim.sh` runs `xcodebuild clean build` automatically; no manual intervention needed.

`sim.sh` bumps `app.json`'s `ios.buildNumber` on every local build so Settings' "vX.Y.Z (N)" reflects the build actually installed. This is an EAS-independent counter — `appVersionSource: "remote"` in `eas.json` means EAS ignores this field and manages its own build number for TestFlight/App Store builds (`ship.sh`), so the two numbers are expected to diverge; `ios.buildNumber` only ever tracks local sim/device installs.

`sim.sh` only targets simulators and USB-connected physical devices — it does **not** offer a TestFlight/EAS-cloud-build option. A dev-client build (`developmentClient: true` in `eas.json`) requires the Xcode Debug configuration, which compiles React Native's `RCTKeyCommands.m` (`#if RCT_DEV`) into the binary. That file calls the private `UIEvent` selectors `_isKeyDown`, `_modifierFlags`, `_modifiedInput` to support hardware-keyboard dev-menu shortcuts — Apple's App Store Connect binary validator rejects any upload referencing them, so dev-client builds can never pass TestFlight/App Store submission, independent of SDK image version. Use `ship.sh` (the `production` profile — Release config, no dev client) for anything that needs to reach App Store Connect or TestFlight.

## App Store Submission Prerequisites

Run these once before the first `ship.sh` invocation (or after credentials expire):

```bash
# 1. Log in to EAS
eas login

# 2. Set up iOS distribution certificate + provisioning profile (interactive)
cd mobile && eas credentials
# → Choose: Build Credentials → iOS → production → follow prompts

# 3. Set up App Store Connect API key (interactive, first submit only)
cd mobile && eas submit --platform ios --profile production --latest
# → Choose an existing ASC API key or add a new one
# Key is cached on EAS servers after first setup — subsequent ship.sh runs are non-interactive
```

**Required fields in `mobile/app.json`:**
- `expo.ios.infoPlist.ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption: false` — required for all App Store uploads (this app uses no encryption)
- `expo.icon` — points to `./assets/icon/icon-1024.png` (1024×1024 PNG, the Braun Terminal photo cropped to square)

**Required fields in `mobile/eas.json`:**
- `build.production.ios.image: "latest"` — ensures Xcode 26+ is used; Apple requires the iOS 26 SDK for all new submissions as of 2026

## Shared Layer

**Pure transform pattern** — every command is a pure function: `Task[]` in, result out. No I/O, no console output, no `process.exit`.

**Error handling** — transforms throw `Error` with a plain message. The CLI catches and calls `process.exit(1)`. Mobile catches and shows an inline error or alert. `process.exit` never appears in shared code.

**`@shared/*` alias** — mobile imports shared code via `@shared/parser`, `@shared/commands/focus`, etc., resolved by Metro (watchFolders) and babel-plugin-module-resolver.

## Console Layer

**File resolution order** (in `resolveFile`): `--file` flag → `TODO_FILE` env → `./todo.txt` in cwd.

**Mutation pattern**: shared transforms return `{ tasks: Task[] }`. Console commands write `tasks` back via `writeTasks`, which writes each `task.raw` verbatim. `serializeTask` is called inside shared transforms before returning.

**Focus clears the terminal**: `t` (no args) and `t focus` both write `\x1Bc` to stdout before rendering, giving a clean screen on every invocation.

## Mobile Layer

**Tech stack**: Expo SDK 52, Expo Router v3, React Native (iOS only), expo-file-system, react-native-reanimated, react-native-gesture-handler, @expo-google-fonts/jetbrains-mono, chrono-node.

**Design tokens**: background `#1A1A1A`, accent `#E8461A`, text `#F0F0F0`, secondary `#888888`, separator `#333333`, checkboxBorder `#555555`. Task text in JetBrains Mono. One accent color only — Braun/Bauhaus. Never use hardcoded hex colors — always reference `Colors.*` from `mobile/src/theme.ts`. Never use hardcoded font families — always use `Fonts.mono`. `Colors.eventDot` (`#8E5FD9`, a muted purple) is a single, deliberate, user-approved exception to the one-accent-color rule — scoped only to the Calendar mini-grid's density dots (issue #81), to distinguish task days from event days the way Apple Calendar uses two dot colors. Don't reuse it elsewhere (e.g. `EventPill.tsx` and the agenda row's `agendaIconEvent`/`agendaIconOverdue` stay `Colors.accent`-only).

**Storage: local-only** (no iCloud). The app stores `todo.txt` at `LOCAL_PATH` (the app's own Documents directory — always writable, no entitlement required) and always has, for every device. An earlier iCloud-container-based sync approach (custom ubiquity container, native `expo-icloud` module, `NSUbiquitousContainers` entitlements) was built, debugged extensively, and then removed (2026-07) after discovering that this Mac — and apparently any Mac without a locally-installed counterpart app — never actively syncs down content for a third-party iOS app's private ubiquity container, regardless of Info.plist configuration. Rather than depend on that fragile mechanism, moving data between devices is now a deliberate, manual action via Settings' Import/Export (see below), not automatic background sync.

**`resolveFile()` never persists or trusts a stored path — it always returns `LOCAL_PATH` computed fresh** (`mobile/src/store.ts`). This is a deliberate fix, not the original design: `config.filePath` used to be a persisted absolute string (embedding the sandbox container UUID, e.g. `.../Application/E662E869-.../Documents/todo.txt`), written once via a "switch to local" action and re-read on every launch. After a native rebuild (new pod added, entitlements removed) that persisted string silently stopped matching what `FileSystem.documentDirectory` resolves to at runtime — `readTasks` swallows the resulting read failure and returns `[]`, so the entire task list appeared to vanish with **no error surfaced at all**, even though the actual `todo.txt` on disk was completely intact. Since there is now only ever one valid storage location, don't reintroduce a persisted file-path setting — compute `LOCAL_PATH` fresh every time. (`weekStart` has no such fragility — it's just a small persisted number, not an absolute path — so it's still read from `todo-config.json`.)

**Settings: Import/Export** (`mobile/app/settings.tsx`): the "Transfer" section replaces the old LOCAL/iCLOUD picker.
- **Export**: serializes current tasks (`serializeTasks`) to a temp file in `FileSystem.cacheDirectory` and hands it to the native OS share sheet (`Share.share({ url, title })`) — AirDrop, Mail, Save to Files, etc.
- **Import**: uses `expo-document-picker` (`copyToCacheDirectory: true`, so the picked file is read via a normal local URI rather than a security-scoped bookmark) to pick a todo.txt file, then reads it with `FileSystem.readAsStringAsync`. Replace-only, not merge — parses the file content with `parseLine` (mirroring `readTasks`'s own parsing), writes it to `LOCAL_PATH`, and reloads. A destructive confirm (`Alert.alert`, naming the picked file) gates the replace. An earlier version used a paste-text-box instead of a file picker; that was replaced because pasting a real todo.txt (1MB+, thousands of lines) into a mobile `TextInput`/system pasteboard is unreliable at that size. Merge was deliberately not built — reconciling recurrence/completion state across two todo.txt snapshots is a much harder problem than this needed, and replace matches how the old LOCAL/iCLOUD switch already behaved (pick a source, load that snapshot).

**Surfacing storage errors**: `readTasks` (`mobile/src/store.ts`) swallows read failures and returns `[]` (a missing file is a normal, expected state). `writeTasks` throws a descriptive `Error` on write failure. `TaskContext.reload` catches errors into `error: string | null` state; `RootLayout` renders an `ErrorBanner` (`mobile/app/_layout.tsx`) above the `BottomActionBar` whenever `error` is non-null.

**`save()` and filePath stale-closure**: `TaskContext` exposes `save(updated)` which writes via `writeTasks`. To avoid a stale-closure race (where `save` captured `filePath = ''` before `reload()` completed), `TaskProvider` maintains a `filePathRef` that is updated synchronously alongside `setFilePath`. `save` reads `filePathRef.current` as its primary path source and falls back to the `filePath` closure value. Never rely on the `filePath` state variable alone inside `save`.

**AddTaskModal empty-title guard**: `handleAdd` silently returns when `title.trim()` is empty — it does NOT show an error. This is intentional: on iPad with a hardware keyboard, `onSubmitEditing` fires on Return, and showing "Enter a title." for a keyboard no-op would be confusing. The Add button's `disabled={!title.trim()}` already prevents touch-driven submission on an empty title.

**Custom recurrence drum pickers — 216pt height** (`mobile/src/components/CustomRecurrencePicker.tsx`, `drumRow`/`pickerWrap` styles): every `@react-native-picker/picker` wheel in this file (the `every [N] [unit]` row, and month's positional "On Week" ordinal/weekday row) is boxed at `height: 216`, not a smaller value. iOS's native `UIPickerView`, which backs the wheel-style picker, ignores whatever frame it's given and pins itself to a 216pt minimum height — a shorter box doesn't shrink the wheel, it just lets the wheel's rendered content overflow past the box and bleed into whatever renders next in the tree, since neither the box nor its siblings clip overflow. This was invisible for years because the only content ever placed directly below a drum row was the month unit's collapsed-by-default "On Days"/"On Week" sub-rows; it became visible (issue #62) once the weekly "Repeat On" chip grid started rendering unconditionally right below the drum row.

**Custom weekly recurrence — weekday multi-select** (`mobile/src/components/CustomRecurrencePicker.tsx`): when `config.unit === 'week'`, a "Repeat On" chip grid (Sun–Sat) lets the user multi-select which weekdays a task recurs on, reusing the same `dayGrid`/`dayChip` styles as the month view's "On Days" grid — but unlike that single-select grid, it's a plain multi-select toggle with no collapse/chevron (auto-collapsing on each tap would be hostile to picking several days) and no `subValue`/active-state summary of its own; the current selection is only reflected in the "Repeat" row's `recurrenceLabel()` summary one level up. `toggleWeekDay` never appends the clicked day to the end of `config.weekDays` — it always rebuilds the array by filtering the canonical `Sun,M,T,W,Th,F,Sat`-ordered `WEEKDAYS` constant, so `weekDays` stays pre-sorted regardless of click order. Both `recurrenceLabel()` (`RecurrencePicker.tsx`) and `customRecurrenceExtensions()` (`CustomRecurrencePicker.tsx`) rely on that invariant and `.join(',')` the array directly without re-sorting — neither is responsible for ordering. The day codes (`Sun`, `M`, `T`, `W`, `Th`, `F`, `Sat`) match `FREQ_DAY_DOW` in `shared/commands/focus.ts` exactly, since `customRecurrenceExtensions` writes them straight into the `frequency-day:` extension that `nextWeeklyDate` already consumes. Selecting "week" with zero chips picked is a valid, non-erroring state — `frequency-day` is simply omitted and the task recurs on the same weekday as `start:`, matching the plain "Every Week" preset.

**Calendar view filtering**: `app/calendar.tsx` uses `applyFocusForWindow(tasks, todayStr, windowEnd)` + `focusItemOccurrence(item)` from `@shared/commands/focus` — the same logic as the console's `focus` command. Never duplicate this filtering in the mobile layer. The window must be at least `addDays(todayStr, 14)` so overdue recurring tasks (whose `nextWeeklyDate` lands beyond today but whose `focusSortKey` resolves to today via `overdueOccurrenceDate`) pass `isInFocusWindow`.

**Calendar navigation pattern**: tapping a date in Calendar's built-in mini-grid scrolls the agenda list to that date within the same screen (`scrollToDate`); tapping a date in Year view jumps into Calendar at that date via `requestDateJump` + `router.push('/calendar')`. The ViewSwitcher (bottom-left ≡) and BottomActionBar label together support: Day (labels the Calendar screen), Year, Search, Settings.

**Mini month-grid density dots** (`app/calendar.tsx`): each day cell shows up to 3 dots per category — `Colors.accent` for days with tasks (`incomplete`/`completed` kind items), `Colors.eventDot` for days with events (`event` kind) — instead of a single uniform has-any-item dot, so glancing at the grid conveys how busy a day is (issue #81). Counts come from a `dateCounts: Map<string, { taskCount, eventCount }>` built in the same pass as `byDate` in the `sections` useMemo — no second iteration over `tasks`. A day with 0 of both still renders the invisible `dotPlaceholder` so every cell keeps identical row height regardless of dot count.

**Temporal navigation consistency**: both remaining calendar views (Calendar, Year) have `‹`/`›` arrow buttons in the header and horizontal swipe gestures. Swipe uses `activeOffsetX([-20, 20]).failOffsetY([-10, 10])` so vertical scrolling still works in views that scroll. Year view scopes the swipe gesture to the header bar only to avoid conflicting with the month-list ScrollView body.

**Safe area handling**: `_layout.tsx` sets `headerShown: false` globally, so every screen is responsible for its own safe-area padding. Use `useSafeAreaInsets()` from `react-native-safe-area-context` and apply `paddingTop: insets.top` to the top-most View or ScrollView in every screen. Screens that already do this: `calendar.tsx`, `year.tsx` (on the header), `search.tsx`, `settings.tsx`.

**Search screen** (`app/search.tsx`): uses `useSafeAreaInsets` with `paddingTop: insets.top` on the input row so the status bar / Dynamic Island does not overlap the text field. Checkbox tap quick-completes/undoes via the same `usePendingDone` hook Calendar uses (issue #80) — `TaskRow` gives the checkbox its own `onCheckboxPress` tap target, separate from the row's `onPress` (navigate to detail). `type:event`/birthday tasks show a ◆ diamond instead of a □ checkbox (mirroring Calendar's agenda row) and are quick-completable too — there is no guard against it, since "done" on an event means "attended," a deliberate product decision, not an oversight.

**`TaskRow`'s checkbox must use gesture-handler's `TouchableOpacity`, not React Native's core one** (`mobile/src/components/TaskRow.tsx`): the row is wrapped in `Swipeable` (a `react-native-gesture-handler` component), and nesting a plain RN `TouchableOpacity` two levels deep inside it (row → checkbox) produces unreliable real-device touch arbitration — invisible in the simulator, only surfacing on physical hardware. A plain-RN-inside-GH checkbox showed its press-in flash but the gesture handler canceled the touch before `onPress` committed (looked like "checkbox does nothing"); switching only the inner checkbox to GH's `TouchableOpacity` then made the *outer* row win every tap instead (checkbox always navigated to detail). Keeping the whole nested hierarchy — both the row and the checkbox — on gesture-handler's own `TouchableOpacity` is what actually resolves it, since GH's touchables are built to nest correctly with each other and with `Swipeable`.

**`usePendingDone` keys pending state by `task.raw`, not `task.line`** (`mobile/src/hooks/usePendingDone.ts`): `applyRm` renumbers every task after the deleted index, so a line-keyed pending timer could fire against a completely different task if a row above it was deleted while the timer was still running (issue #80). It also flushes (commits, via `applyDone` + `save`) any still-pending completions on unmount rather than silently discarding them — Search (unlike Calendar, which never really unmounts) can be popped via back-navigation mid-window, and losing a completion with no error would be silent data loss.

**Section headers** across screens use `fontSize: 11`, `letterSpacing: 2`, `fontFamily: Fonts.mono`. `app/calendar.tsx`'s date-grouped agenda sections use `Colors.textSecondary`, brightening to `Colors.accent` for today's section (`sectionTitleToday`).

**Task detail** (`app/task/[line].tsx`): shows a **DUE** row when `task.extensions['start']` is set, using `taskOccurrence(task, todayStr)` (from `@shared/commands/focus`) to compute the displayed date — the same canonical occurrence logic used by Calendar/Focus views — rather than formatting the raw `start:` field directly. This keeps Task Detail's DUE date consistent with every other screen, including self-healing already-corrupted `start:` values (e.g. an invalid day-of-month) without a data migration. One side effect: for an ongoing multi-day `type:event` (`start:` in the past, `end:` in the future), DUE now shows "today" instead of the event's original start date, matching how Calendar/Focus already display such events. The date is tinted accent-red when overdue (computed due date `< todayStr` and task not done). Shows an **AGE** row (`N years`) via `computeYearCount` (from `@shared/commands/list`) for `type:birthday`/`type:anniversary` tasks. Delete alert message differs for recurring tasks: non-recurring says "This cannot be undone"; recurring says "This deletes all future occurrences. Use Skip to skip just this one." — because `applyRm` removes the single todo.txt line that defines all occurrences. Dismiss via the `✕` in `closeBtn`, positioned top-left (`left: Spacing.md`) — matching `AddTaskModal`'s dismiss convention — not a "Cancel" action button in the actions row; the actions row only ever holds destructive/committing actions (Done/Undo, Edit/Save Edit, Skip, Delete). When `task.done`, the "Done" button is replaced by "Undo" (`applyUndone` from `@shared/commands/done`), which flips `done` back to `false` and returns to the previous screen — mirroring the checkbox-tap-to-undo behavior already in `usePendingDone.ts`. `applyUndone` skips (no-ops) tasks that still carry a live `frequency`+`start` pair, but that's never the task actually shown here: `applyDone` never leaves the recurring master itself `done: true` (it resets `done` to `false` and appends a separate completed copy with no `frequency` extension), so any done task reachable via Task Detail is always a plain, non-recurring completion and Undo always succeeds. `handleRow` (the container for the drag handle + `closeBtn`) is a fixed `height: 44`, not `paddingVertical` sized to the 4px drag-handle bar alone — `closeBtn` is absolutely positioned with `top: 0, bottom: 0`, which stretches its box to match the parent's height, so a row sized only for the handle bar leaves the `✕` (`lineHeight: 26`) nowhere to render without overflowing off-screen.

**Default view**: The app opens to Calendar (`app/index.tsx` redirects to `/calendar`). BottomActionBar defaults to the `'Day'` label for unknown routes — the screen/route/file are still named "Calendar" internally (issue #72 renamed only the user-facing label, not the route).

**Calendar view** (`app/calendar.tsx`): scrollable agenda using `FlatList` (not `SectionList`) with two row-height constants `HEADER_H = 34` and `ROW_H = 44`. Offsets are pre-computed alongside `flatData` in a single O(n) useMemo pass and used by `getItemLayout` — this is required for `scrollToIndex` to work reliably when the target row is outside the initial render window. `initialScrollIndex` is set to today's index so the list opens at today without a `useEffect` delay. Sections sort items `incomplete → event → completed` using `KIND_ORDER = { incomplete: 0, event: 1, completed: 2 }`, then within the `incomplete` kind by `isOverdue` (overdue items first, tiebroken by their visible `overdueDate` label) before falling back to time-of-day (`item.time`, untimed first) within each kind — the `isOverdue` tiebreak exists because an overdue item's hidden `start:` time-of-day would otherwise interleave it with same-day timed tasks instead of clustering with other overdue items, the same "sort by a time the user can never see" bug `sortKeyFor` was already fixed for (issue #76), just recurring one level down in this screen's own within-day secondary sort (issue #79). The event-kind secondary sort matters for a different reason: its items are populated by iterating the raw task list via `generateTaskOccurrences` rather than through `applyFocusForWindow`'s own time-aware sort, so without it same-day events kept their todo.txt file order instead of chronological order (issue #78).

**Overdue tasks in calendar**: any occurrence whose date is before today is pinned to today's section (`date = todayStr`) so it appears in today's agenda rather than a past date. The original past date is stored as `overdueDate` on the `AgendaItem` and shown as a label like `"due Apr 18"` in accent color beneath the task title.

**Event occurrence generation** — `generateTaskOccurrences(task, fromStr, cutoffStr)` in `shared/commands/focus.ts` is the single source of truth for expanding recurring tasks/events into individual dated occurrences. It respects `recur-until`, `exdate`, `frequency`, `every`, `frequency-day`, and `frequency-month-day`. **Never duplicate this logic in mobile screens** — import it from `@shared/commands/focus`. Recurring tasks/events without a `recur-until` and with a `start:` date in the past will recur indefinitely; the data fix is to add `recur-until` to the task line.

**Multi-day event end-date badge** (`app/calendar.tsx`, issue #82): a non-recurring `type:event` whose `end:` date genuinely differs from `start:` gets an `endDate` field on its `AgendaItem`, shown in the row's badge slot (mutually exclusive with the overdue/time badges) as `formatMonthDayNumeric(item.endDate)` (e.g. `"8/19"`) plus a days-remaining suffix from `daysLeftLabel(daysUntil(dateStr, item.endDate))` (e.g. `"8/19 · 5d left"`, or `"· last day"` on the final day) — both helpers live in `mobile/src/uiUtils.ts`. `daysUntil` is computed from each row's own `dateStr`, not from `todayStr`, so the count shrinks correctly as the span progresses across its multiple agenda rows (one per spanned day, per `generateTaskOccurrences`).

**Birthday badge & age display**: `%birthday` (`shared/parser.ts`) is a standalone tag that aliases to `type:birthday` only when a task has no other `type:` extension — an explicit `type:` (e.g. `type:event`, so the task still displays as an ordinary event everywhere `!!task.extensions['type']` is checked) always wins and is left untouched. Because of that, `isBirthday()` and `computeYearCount()` (`shared/commands/list.ts`) don't rely solely on `extensions['type'] === 'birthday'` — they also independently test the raw `%birthday` tag against `task.text`, so a `%birthday`-tagged task keeps the cake icon and age even when `type:` resolved to something else. `birthdayLabel(task, todayStr)` builds the combined badge (`"🎂 51 "`, or just `"🎂 "` when the age can't be computed) and every call site **prefixes** it to the title (`birthdayLabel(...) + cleanTitle(...)`) rather than appending — narrow single-line rows (Calendar's mini-grid day cells, agenda rows) truncate with `numberOfLines={1}`, and a prefix survives truncation while a trailing badge would get clipped by the ellipsis. `TaskRow` and `EventPill` take `todayStr` as an explicit prop since, unlike the screen files, they have no local `today()` call of their own.

## Key Invariants

- `verbatimModuleSyntax: true` — use `import type` for all type-only imports (all layers).
- Completed tasks have no priority (stripped by `serializeTask` when `task.done = true`).
- Typed tasks (`type:event`/`birthday`/`anniversary` — anything with `task.extensions['type']` set) never carry a priority — this is a deliberate product decision (issue #66), not an oversight. `AddTaskModal`'s Priority group only renders when `addType === 'task'`, and `handleAdd` defensively re-checks `addType === 'task'` before applying the picked priority (state persists across the TASK/EVENT toggle even though the UI hides it). `task/[line].tsx`'s Priority section only renders when `!task.extensions['type']`. Don't re-add priority to either screen for events without confirming first — it was added once already and reverted for exactly this reason.
- Extension regex `([^/\s]\S*)` intentionally excludes URL schemes — values starting with `/` are not captured as extensions (prevents `http://` from matching as `http: //`).
- `matchesFilters()` in `shared/commands/list.ts` is exported and reused by console `listall`, `search`, and mobile.
- `today()` returns the **local** calendar date (not UTC) — both `console/output.ts` and `mobile/src/utils.ts`.
- `nextWeeklyDate` in `shared/commands/focus.ts` accepts an optional `frequencyDay` param (e.g. `"W,F"`). When present, it finds the next calendar date that falls on one of those weekdays rather than advancing by 7-day intervals.
- `focusSortKey` skips the `last-done` cycle check for `frequency-day` tasks. For those tasks `applyDone` already advances `start:` to the next valid weekday, so `last-done` will always precede `currentOcc` — applying the 7-day cycle window would incorrectly jump to the occurrence after next (e.g. showing Monday when Friday is correct).
- `rm` accepts multiple task numbers. Re-indexes remaining tasks after each removal so subsequent numbers in the same batch stay correct.
- `done` accepts either a task number or a text string. When passed a string (`t done "buy milk"`), it creates the task and immediately marks it complete, writing `x <today> <today> <text>` to the file.
- `applyDone`'s recurring-task branch appends a new completed "copy" `Task` (the `x <date> ...` line recording this occurrence) with `line: tasks.length + 1` — never a placeholder like `line: 0`, matching `applyAdd`'s convention for appended tasks. Mobile's `TaskContext.save()` sets React state directly from whatever a shared transform returns, with no re-read/renumber in between saves (unlike the CLI, which is stateless per invocation and always re-reads fresh). A placeholder line number here would let two completed recurring tasks collide on the same `line` value within one app session, which several mobile screens key list rows by (`key={task.line}`, `done-${t.line}-${date}` in `calendar.tsx`) — a duplicate-React-key crash (issue #61).
- `done` advances `start` to the next scheduled occurrence for `frequency:weekly`, `frequency:monthly`, and `frequency:daily` tasks. `frequency:yearly` tasks are the exception — `start:`'s year is never advanced (only `last-done` changes), since yearly occurrence math (`nextYearlyDate`) only needs `start:`'s month-day, not its year, and freezing the year preserves the original birth/anniversary year for age calculation (`computeYearCount`) and for `every:N>1` multi-year cycling (which needs a fixed anchor year).
- Recurring occurrence dates (`nextYearlyDate`, `nextMonthlyDate`, `overdueOccurrenceDate`, `resolvePositionalDay` in `shared/commands/focus.ts`) always clamp the day-of-month to the last valid day of the target month via `daysInMonth()` (`shared/utils.ts`) — e.g. a `start:` day of 31 in a 30-day month becomes day 30, Feb 29 becomes Feb 28 in non-leap years. This prevents a raw invalid date string (e.g. `2026-06-31`) from being interpreted differently by different screens (native `Date` parsing silently overflows it into July 1, while raw string comparisons don't).
- `nextMonthlyDate` and `overdueOccurrenceDate` build their day-of-month candidate `Date` at **noon** (`new Date(year, month, day, 12, 0, 0)`), matching the noon timestamp used for `today`/`t` (`new Date(todayStr + 'T12:00:00')`) — never construct one at local midnight and compare it against the other at noon. A midnight-vs-noon mismatch makes a same-calendar-day candidate register as "already passed" (`candidate < t`) purely from the time-of-day difference, not the actual date. This caused issue #74: right after completing a monthly task, `applyDone` advances `start:` to next month and stamps `last-done` with today; on the next render `effToday()` (`applyFocusForWindow`) substitutes that new `start:` as a fake "today," and the midnight/noon mismatch then misjudged that future date as already-due, resurfacing the just-completed task on today's list labeled with its own future due date (e.g. "due Aug 15" appearing the moment a July 15 occurrence was marked done). `overdueOccurrenceDate`'s monthly branch also now requires the candidate be *strictly* before `today` (`currCandidate >= t` returns null) to match its own doc comment and the weekly branch's `diffDays <= 0` → not-overdue behavior — a monthly task due exactly today and not yet completed is due, not overdue, until the day passes.
- `applyFocusForWindow`'s `sortKeyFor` (`shared/commands/focus.ts`) sorts overdue items by **date only** — never appends the task's start time-of-day. The calendar agenda row (`mobile/app/calendar.tsx`) always replaces an overdue item's time with a "due `<date>`" label, so a hidden time-of-day in the sort key produces a list position the user can never explain by looking at the row. This caused issue #76: a weekly task whose current cycle lands exactly on today (not yet done) is correctly flagged overdue with `overdueDate` = today, but its `start:` time-of-day (e.g. `T14:00`) got appended to the sort key, sorting it after same-day timed items instead of clustering with the other, earlier-dated overdue items at the top of the list — the bug was invisible for genuinely-overdue-from-an-earlier-date items only because their date alone already sorted them ahead of every today-dated item, time suffix or not.
- `skip` on a non-recurring task (no `frequency:` extension) removes it from the list instead of erroring. `applySkip` returns a `SkipResult` union: `{ removed: true }` or `{ removed: false; skippedDate; nextDate }`. For overdue weekly/monthly tasks, `applySkip` uses `overdueOccurrenceDate()` to add the actual missed occurrence date to `exdate` — NOT `focusSortKey` (which returns today for overdue tasks and would fail to advance past the missed occurrence).
- `add` and `event` inject `start:today` when no `start:` is provided. This makes new tasks appear in focus immediately.
- `focus` handles `frequency:yearly` via `nextYearlyDate` in `isInFocusWindow` and `focusSortKey` — without this, completed yearly tasks stayed visible in focus until the next occurrence's date passed.
- `focus` shows **overdue** tasks: regular tasks whose `start:` date is in the past, and recurring tasks whose most-recent scheduled occurrence hasn't been marked done. `overdueOccurrenceDate()` detects missed occurrences; their sort key is set to today so they sort to the top.
- **Task line numbers** are 1-based positions in the non-empty task list (blank lines stripped by `readTasks`). They renumber on every read — `task.line` is display position, not a stable ID.
- `cleanTitle()` strips todo.txt extensions from task text for display. It is defined **inline** in each screen file — it is not exported from a shared module.
